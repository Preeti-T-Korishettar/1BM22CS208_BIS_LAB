 PSO Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialization**:
   - Define the problem space and bounds.
   - Initialize a population of particles with random positions and velocities.
   - Set personal best positions and global best position.

2. **For each iteration**:
   - For each particle:
     1. Evaluate the objective function at the particle's current position.
     2. If the current value is better than the particle's personal best:
        - Update the personal best position and value.
     3. If the current value is better than the global best:
        - Update the global best position and value.
     4. Update the particle's velocity:
        \[
        v_{i}^{new} = w \cdot v_{i}^{old} + c_1 \cdot r_1 \cdot (p_{i} - x_{i}) + c_2 \cdot r_2 \cdot (g - x_{i})
        \]
     5. Update the particle's position:
        \[
        x_{i}^{new} = x_{i}^{old} + v_{i}^{new}
        \]
     6. Ensure the particle's position is within bounds.

3. **Termination**:
   - Stop if the maximum number of iterations is reached or if a satisfactory solution is found.

You can use this outline to implement the algorithm in your preferred programming language! If you need more details or examples, feel free to ask!
