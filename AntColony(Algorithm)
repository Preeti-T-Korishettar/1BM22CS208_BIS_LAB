Overview of Ant Colony Optimization for TSP
The ACO algorithm simulates a group of artificial ants that:
1. Explore various routes.
2. Leave "pheromones" on paths based on the quality of the route (shorter paths get more
pheromones).
3. Other ants are influenced by the pheromone levels and probability of choosing paths with stronger pheromone trails, leading to an exploration and reinforcement of better solutions over time.


Algorithm Steps
1. Initialize Pheromones: Set initial pheromone levels on all edges between cities.
2. Construct Ant Solutions:
Each ant constructs a complete tour by moving probabilistically between cities, influenced by pheromone levels and the distance (favoring closer cities).
3. Evaluate Solutions:
Calculate the length of each ant's tour.
Identify the best tour in this iteration.
4. Update Pheromones:
Evaporate pheromones on all edges to avoid convergence to a single path.
Deposit additional pheromone on paths of ants based on the quality of their solutions (shorter paths get more pheromone).
5. Repeat:
Repeat steps 2-4 for a set number of iterations or until a satisfactory solution is found.
