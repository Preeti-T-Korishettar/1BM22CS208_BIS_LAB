Step1: Randomly initialize the population of grey wolves Xi  (i=1,2,…,n)
Step2: Initialize the value of a=2, A and C  ( using eq.3)
Step3: Calculate the fitness of each member of the population
Xα=member with the best fitness value
Xβ=second best member ( in terms of fitness value)
Xδ=third best member (in terms of fitness value)
Step4: FOR t = 1 to Max_number_of_iterations:
Update the position of all the omega wolves by eq. 4, 5 and 6
Update a, A, C (using eq. 3)
a = 2(1-t/T)
Calculate Fitness of all search agents
Update Xα, Xβ, Xδ.
            END FOR
Step5: return Xα
